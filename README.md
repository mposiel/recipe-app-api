Site link: https://ec2-13-53-193-188.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com/api/docs

Welcome to the heart of a recipe app: a slick backend with user authentication, smooth database connections, and loads of tests to keep everything running. 

### The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
> - Building a REST API
> - Django
> - Test Driven Development
> - Python
> - User Authentication

#### More specifically, I used the following:
> - PostgreSQL
> - Django ORM
> - RESTful API guidelines
> - HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, status codes)
> - Testing API Endpoints (SwaggerUI & Postman)
> - Docker (Container, Image, Deploying on Docker Hub)
> - AWS (Hosting an EC2 instance)
